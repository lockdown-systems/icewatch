        <h1>About ICE Detention Map</h1>
        <p class="intro">
            Donald Trump <a
                href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-speech-congress-transcript-751b5891a3265ff1e5c1409c391fef7c"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener">pretends</a> that his mass deportation policy targets "murderers, human
            traffickers, gang members, and other criminals." <strong>But ICE's own data proves that he's lying. The vast
                majority of people detained by ICE have no criminal records.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            The US government is <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/2582/text"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener">required</a> to publish weekly data on the population of individuals
            detained by ICE, including the facilities where they are being held. ICE quietly publishes this data <a
                href="https://www.ice.gov/detain/detention-management" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on its
                website</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The data includes each immigration detention center along with its population breakdown, including whether
            individuals are considered "non-criminal" or "criminal", and their "ICE Threat Level". Many of the people
            locked up by ICE pose no threat at all, according to ICE data.
        </p>
        <p>
            This website visualizes the public data provided directly by ICE. It automatically updates whenever ICE
            publishes new data.

        <blockquote>
            <p>Of all the statistics in the spreadsheet, this may be the most telling: Of the 46,113 individuals detained by ICE, 71% have no criminal record. That finding was highlighted Friday at the Hackers on Planet Earth conference in Queens, New York, where the privacy organization Lockdown Systems unveiled a new tool that visualizes all of ICE's data on an interactive map of the country.</p>
