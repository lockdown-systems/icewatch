        <h1>About ICEWatch</h1>
        <p>
            Under Section 216 of <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/2582/text"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Fiscal Year 2020 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations
                Bill</a>, the US government is required to publish weekly data on the population of individuals detained
            by ICE, including the facilities where they are being held.<br><br>

            The data is quietly published on the <a href="https://www.ice.gov/detain/detention-management"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener">ICE Website</a>, where if you scroll to the bottom, you'll find a link to
            an Excel spreadsheet. That spreadsheet shows you who is detained in ICE facilities, at the time of this
            writing, over 47,000 people â€“ the vast majority of whom have no criminal records. This is despite the
            rhetoric from the Trump administration of targeting "the worst of the worst".<br><br>

            Our dashboard shows each immigration detention center and their population breakdown: whether they are
            considered "non-criminal" or "criminal", and their "ICE Threat Level". ICE's own data shows that they are
            detaining people who apparently pose no threat at all.

            dataset and its importance.
